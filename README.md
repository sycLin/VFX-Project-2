# Project Intro

In this project, we are asked to implement part of the _Recognising Panoramas_ paper.

There are basically 5 steps:

- feature detection
- feature matching
- image matching
- bundle adjustment
- blending

And we have to do the 4 of them:

- [ ] feature detection
- [ ] feature matching
- [ ] image matching
- [ ] blending
